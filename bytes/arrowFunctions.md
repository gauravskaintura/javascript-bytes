An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations. 

For Example,

    const materials = [
        'Hydrogen',
        'Helium',
        'Lithium',
        'Beryllium'
    ];

    console.log(materials.map(material => material.length));
    // expected output: Array [8, 6, 7, 9]
