# Closures
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

For Example,

     function init() {
      var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
      function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
        alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
      }
      displayName();
    }
    init();
Consider the following code:

    function makeFunc() {
      var name = 'Mozilla';
      function displayName() {
        alert(name);
      }
      return displayName;
    }
    
        var myFunc = makeFunc();
        myFunc();
